Dear Urban Design Commission, 

I'm writing on behalf of Madison Properties.  

They are proposing to replace their existing facilities building at 1810 S. parking with a new metal building and will continue to house their current facilities operations--including offices for personal, in addition to site storage for a wide variety of operations and repair equipment.

The existing building, slated to be demolished, is very much in disrepair and is beyond simple renovation.

With Madison Properties current facilities operation, and the metal recycling and auto repair operations, to name a few, the uses along the existing gravel easement to the north, are very much industrial in nature. Inline with these neighboring industrial uses, design-wise, Madison Properties is proposing a straight-forward utility building to house their ongoing facility operations.

As present, due to the fact that this existing structure is pushed back behind the existing brick building that fronts Park Steet, it's presence is hardly felt along this corridor.  As the new building is essentially replacing their existing footprint, it's presence, as well, will not have much visual impact along Park Street. 

Madison Properties would also like to propose an unenclosed area for their  trash and recycling bins.  Their proposed location, on the far southwest corner of the building, will not make this area visible from Park St, or any other public corridor.

The condenser units on the roof of the new structure are proposed to not be screened or enclosed, as their location in the middle of the roof and behind the parapet of the existing brick building to the east, makes them not visible from the Park Street corridor.

Madison Properites looks forward to replacing their current
