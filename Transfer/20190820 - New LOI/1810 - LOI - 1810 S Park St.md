Dear Urban Design Commission, 

I'm writing on behalf of Madison Properties.  

They are proposing to replace part of their existing facilities at 1810 S. with a new metal building and will continue to house their current facilities operations--including offices for personal, in addition to site storage for a wide variety of operations and repair equipment.

The existing building, slated to be demolished, is very much in disrepair and is beyond simple renovation.

With Madison Properties current facilities operation, and the metal recycling and auto repair operations, to name a few, the uses along the existing gravel easement to the north, are very much industrial in nature. Inline with these neighboring industrial uses, design-wise, Madison Properties is proposing a straight-forward utility building to house their ongoing facility operations.

As present, due to the fact that this existing structure is pushed back behind the existing brick building that fronts Park Street, it's presence is not visible along this corridor.  As the new building is essentially replacing their existing footprint, its presence, as well, will have no visual impact along Park Street. 

Madison Properties would also like to propose an unenclosed area for their  trash and recycling bins.  Their proposed location, on the far southwest corner of the building, will not make this area visible from Park St, or any other public corridor.

The condenser units on the roof of the new structure are proposed to not be screened or enclosed, as their location in the middle of the roof and behind the parapet of the existing brick building to the east, makes them not visible from the Park Street corridor.

#### District no. 7 guidelines conformity

The property lies on S. Park Street and is therefore subject to District no. 7 guidelines. The following items show in detail the conformity of the proposed project to the district guidelines as stated in chapter 33, section 33.24 (14) of Madison General Ordinances:

* General aspects (section 14.a): The proposed project helps Madison Properties to remain, maintain and enhance its activities on Park Street for another life cycle, contributing to the long-term economical vitality of the district.
* The proposed project is not only a replacement but also a much higher-quality upgrade of the current facilities (14.d)
* The current setback of 44.5 feet from the property front line remains unchanged, as the front building is existing and not modified by this project. As the front building is existing, the required 10 feet setback (14.d.1) doesn't apply.  Neighboring constructions all have similar or larger setbacks.
* None of the facades visible from Park Street are modified. The modified building proposed by this project, with all its mechanical equipments, is entirely behind and lower than the maintained one, and therefore not visible from Park Street  (14.d.2). The existing facade on Park Street maintains its existing pedestrian character (fully accessible to pedestrians, many entrances, etc)
* The existing building, as well as the new building, are both two stories high (14.d.3). All neighboring constructions are one or two stories high.
* The existing facade on Park Street, being primarily of non-retail use, meets the 40% windows ratio described in (14.d.4.a). **RYAN PLEASE CHECK** Existing windows and entrances fully attend the requirements of item (14.d.4).
* Existing facade materials on Park Street remain unchanged (apparent brick walls and metallic windows and doors)  (14.d.5) **RYAN PLEASE CHECK IF MTLS ARE INDEED THOSE...**
* No new signage is added by the proposed project, nor does the existing situation feature any kind of signage, therefore does item (14.d.6) not apply.
* Existing parking areas, located on the front setback between Park Street and the front facade, and on the North side of the property (behind the front setback) all remain unchanged, due to the impossibility to relocate them. The front parking area is largely pedestrian-friendly already. Tree islands already exist on all parking areas and meet requirements of (14.d.7). No trash area, existing or proposed, is visible from public areas along Park Street. No loading or vehicle service activity occurs near these public/customer access areas.
* Large, existing landscape buffers exist all around the property and specifically between this property and its neighbors, thus meeting item (14.d.8) requirements.
* Several exterior light fixtures exist on the front facade, and are maintained by the proposed project providing adequate lighting of pedestrian areas as required by item (14.d.9). Furthermore, public lighting exists in front of the property, with good covering of the same areas.
* Being out of the referred areas, items (14.d.10), (14.d.11) and (14.d.12)  do not apply to this property.
* The property being single-tenant, both in original and proposed situations, item (14.d.13) does not apply.
* Although of limited historical interest, the existing building facing Park Street still has all its original features and has not seen any significant changes after its construction, and is therefore not in need of the provisions of item (14.d.14).

The only aspect where the proposed project does not reflect the guidelines is regarding the 10 feet setback off Park Street. However, as this project doesn't modify the main building on Park Street, but only the back building, it is impossible to change this situation, and since, as stated in item (14.d.1), that rule only applies for new buildings, we are fully confident that the proposed situation meets all the requirements.



Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
