#### A proposal to replace an existing facilities building at 1810 S. Park Steet.


---
Dear Urban Design Commission, 

I'm writing on behalf of Madison Property Management, Inc. 

They are proposing to replace part of their existing facilities at 1810 S. Park Street with a new metal building to continue to house their current facilities operations--including site storage for a wide variety of operations and an auto repair garage.  

The existing building, slated to be demolished, is very much in disrepair and is beyond simple renovation. The brick building, however, along Park Street will remain unaltered. 

With Madison Properties' current facilities operation, and the metal recycling and auto repair operations, to name a few, the uses along the existing gravel easement to the north, are very much industrial in nature. Inline with these neighboring industrial uses, design-wise, Madison Properties is proposing a straight-forward utility building to house their ongoing facility operations.

As present, due to the fact that this existing structure is pushed back behind the existing brick building that fronts Park Street, it's presence is not visible along this corridor.  As the new building is essentially replacing their existing footprint, its presence, as well, will have no visual impact along Park Street. 

Madison Properties would also like to propose an unenclosed area for their  trash and recycling bins.  Their proposed location, on the far southwest corner of the building, will not be visible from Park St, or any other public corridor.

The condenser units on the roof of the new structure are proposed to not be screened or enclosed, as their location in the middle of the roof and behind the parapet of the existing brick building to the east, makes them not visible from the Park Street corridor.

#### District no. 7 guidelines conformity


* General aspects (section 14.a): The proposed project helps Madison Properties to remain, maintain and enhance its activities on Park Street for another life cycle, contributing to the long-term economical vitality of the district.
* The proposed project is not only a replacement, but also a much higher-quality upgrade of the current facilities (14.d)
* The current setback of 44.5 feet from the front property line remains unchanged, as the front building is existing and not modified by this project. As the front building is existing, the required 10 feet setback (14.d.1) doesn't apply.  Neighboring buildings all have similar or larger setbacks.
* None of the facades visible from Park Street are modified. The modified building proposed by this project, with all its mechanical equipment, is entirely behind and lower than the maintained one, and therefore not visible from Park Street  (14.d.2). The existing facade on Park Street maintains its existing pedestrian character (fully accessible to pedestrians, many entrances, etc)
* The existing building is one story toward the south end of the property, but the toward the north, as the grade drops off, the existing building is 2 stories.  The new proposed building, however, will be 1 1/2 stories tall.  All neighboring buildings are one or two stories high.
* The existing facade on Park Street, being primarily of business and retail use, has about a 20% windows ratio.  The proposed building does not have any windows due to it's proposed use as a storage facility and repair garage.
* The existing brick facade along Park Street will remain unchanged.  Durable vertical metal paneling is proposed for the new building. (14.d.5)
* No new signage is added by the proposed project (14.d.6).
*  Existing parking areas, located on the front setback between Park Street and the front facade, and on the north side of the property all remain unchanged.  The proposed new parking along the north property line includes islands every 12 stalls w/ proposed light light poles and mowed turf (14.d.7). No trash area, existing or proposed, is visible from public areas along Park Street.  All trash is proposed on the far west side behind both new and existing building.  No loading or vehicle service activity occurs near these public/customer access areas.
* The mature and extensive landscape buffers along Park Street and the northeast corner of the site account for double the required landscaping points.
* Although there are a few existing light sconces on the building, in general, new cut-off lighting is proposed throughout the site.(14.d.9)
* Being out of the referred areas, items (14.d.10), (14.d.11) and (14.d.12) do not apply to this property.
* Although of limited historical interest, the existing building facing Park Street still has all its original features and has not seen any significant changes after its construction, and is therefore not in need of the provisions of item (14.d.14).

Madison Properties looks forward to replacing their current dilapidated structure with an efficient structure that is inline with their current use and the majority of the neighboring properties in the area--all while improving the general upkeep of the area. 

Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
